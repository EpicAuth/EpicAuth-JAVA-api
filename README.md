# EpicAuth-JAVA-API

EpicAuth Java Api/Example for For The https://EpicAuth.com Authentication system.

I decided to make an api for java simply because there were none

Example that I used - [EpicAuth-CSHARP-Example](https://github.com/EpicAuth/EpicAuth-CSHARP-Example)

**Information**

There is no encryption for sent requests and iv keys

I guess I just don't know how to make them right
